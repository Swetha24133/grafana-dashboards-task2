 # 🌐 Internship Task 2 - Grafana Cloud Monitoring Dashboard

## 🧩 Descripton

This project is part of my internship Task 2, where I set up a cloud-based monitoring dashboard using **Grafana Cloud** and **Prometheus**. The objective was to create a basic monitoring solution that visualizes key system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network activity. I used Grafana's free cloud tier to build and configure the dashboard and added visualizations using example Prometheus metrics.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Grafana Cloud** – Used to build and host the monitoring dashboard.
- **Prometheus** – Used as a data source for example monitoring metrics.
- **GitHub** – Repository for code, documentation, and screenshots.


## 🚀 Steps Followed

1. Created a Grafana Cloud account and configured a new cloud stack.
2. Set up Prometheus as a data source (using default example or demo metrics).
3. Built a new dashboard named `System Monitoring Dashboard`.
4. Created 4 panels, each representing:
   - **CPU Usage**
   - **Memory Usage**
   - **Disk Space Usage**
   - **Network Usage**
5. Saved and arranged the panels on the dashboard for better visual clarity.
6. Took screenshots of each panel for documentation.
7. Created a GitHub repository to host the README and screenshots.
8. (Optional) Attempted alert setup. Due to lack of live data, alerting was not configured.

## 🔔 Alert Configuration

Although Grafana supports advanced alerting, alerts were not configured in this project due to unavailable real-time data. However, the dashboard is prepared for future alert rule integration, such as:
- Trigger alert if CPU usage > 80%
- Trigger alert if disk usage > 90%
